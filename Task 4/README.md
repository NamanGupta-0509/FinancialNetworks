This repository contains the research paper, analysis, and implementation of a study investigating the multifractal properties of the Indian financial market.

## Research Paper

**Title:** Multifractal Properties of the Indian Financial Market  
**Authors:** Sunil Kumar, Nivedita Deo

The paper explores the multifractal nature of the Indian financial indices (BSE & NSE) and compares them with the US S&P 500 index, using multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MF-DFA).

## Analysis and Implementation

The analysis and implementation cover:

1.  **Data Preprocessing:**
    -   Collection and normalization of daily closing prices.
2.  **MF-DFA Method:**
    -   Calculation of generalized Hurst exponents and multifractal spectra.
3.  **Comparison:**
    -   Comparison of multifractal properties between Indian and US financial markets.

## Key Findings

1.  **Multifractality:**
    -   Both BSE and NSE indices exhibit multifractal properties attributed to long-range correlations and a broad probability density function.
2.  **Comparison with S&P 500:**
    -   Indian markets (BSE and NSE) show higher multifractality compared to the mature US market (S&P 500).
