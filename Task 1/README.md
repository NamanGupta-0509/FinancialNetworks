This contains the research paper, analysis, and implementation of a study exploring topological similarities between human brain networks and financial market networks.

## Research Paper

**Title:** Topological Isomorphisms of Human Brain and Financial Market Networks  
**Authors:** Petra E. VÃ©rtes, Ruth M. Nicol, Sandra C. Chapman, Nicholas W.Watkins, Duncan A. Robertson, Edward T. Bullmore

The paper examines structural similarities between brain and financial networks, highlighting their small-world properties, modularity, and efficiency.

## Analysis and Implementation

The analysis and implementation cover:

-   **Data Preprocessing:** fMRI and financial data
-   **Network Construction:** Creating brain and financial networks
-   **Graph Analysis:** Theoretical analysis and visualization

## Key Findings

-   Both networks exhibit small-world properties and high modularity.
-   Financial networks are more efficient but less robust to disintegration.
-   Real financial data differs from the Black-Scholes model in its correlation structure.
